# Exception Handling

Exceptions are run-time anomalies or abnormal conditions that a program encounters during its execution.
There are two types of exceptions:
a)Synchronous, 
b)Asynchronous(Ex:which are beyond the program’s control, Disc failure etc). 

C++ provides following specialized keywords for this purpose:

- try: represents a block of code that can throw an exception.
- catch: represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown.
- throw: Used to throw an exception. Also used to list the exceptions that a function throws, but doesn’t handle itself.
